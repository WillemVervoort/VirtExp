Hamed (2008) and Koutsoyiannis (2006)
I think the point of these papers is:
1. You cannot assume that a "trend" in data is a real deterministic trend, and the standard Mann Kendall statistic over estimates the significance
2. There is no reason you should "detrend" the data before analysis, but the Koutsoyiannis paper is very much about modelling and making forecasts. In this case we are not really interested in this, we are mainly looking at whether there is a trend.
3. There is a difference between the MK under the scaling hypothesis and the Mann Kendall that takes into account autocorrelation (modifiedmk, Hamed and Rao, 1998).

For our research, we probably need to run all three, but essentially only modifiedmk and normal MK can be run using the 500 simulations. This is because the scaling behaviour analysis takes far too long (18 hours for the weekly data)

Should look at annual, monthly and weekly data.

Essentially there are two ways to approach the MK analysis correctly of the series including the autocorrelation:
1. block bootstrapping
2. Hamed and Rao

The main question is whether there is a need to consider the long term persistence (LTP) in our data. I am not sure how to test this. I think we should do at least the comparison.
If there is no difference we can ignore it.
We will have to run the LTP analysis, H is significant for all flow and rain
done

Need to also run the LTP analysis for the gam residuals. This is trickier as we now only run the GAMM for FLOW >0, so we have NA values in the residuals. MannKendallLTP() does not like NA values. At the moment, I have set residuals == NA to be 0. Checked with Floris on whether this is correct.
