1;Log(Q ) ~ trend + error;linear;40-year trend in streamflow to compare with Mann Kendall analysis.
2;Log(P) ~ trend + error;linear;40-year trend in rainfall to compare with Mann Kendall analysis.
3;Log(Q) ~ s(P) + trend + error;linear;The trend in this model relative to model 1 indicates the importance of other processes.  
4;Log (Q + 1) ~ s(P) + s(maxT, P) + trend + error;linear;Difference between model 3 and 4 is the effect of evapotranspiration on the trend. The remaining trend is related to changes over time in the rainfall runoff response.
5;Log(Q + 1)  ~ s(P) + s(maxT, P) + error;Mann-Kendall;Check if linear trend assumption is biased.
